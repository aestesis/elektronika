 ณ   Now that PC users have entered the realm of programmable hardware,      ณ 
 ณ   graphics programmers can create 3D images and animations comparable     ณ 
 ณ   to those produced by RenderMan's procedural programs--but in real       ณ 
 ณ   time. Here is a book that will bring this cutting-edge technology to    ณ 
 ณ   your computer.                                                          ณ 
 ณ   Beginning with the mathematical basics of vertex and pixel shaders,     ณ 
 ณ   and building to detailed accounts of programmable shader operations,    ณ 
 ณ   Real-Time Shader Programming provides the foundation and techniques     ณ 
 ณ   necessary for replicating popular cinema-style 3D graphics as well as   ณ 
 ณ   creating your own real-time procedural shaders.                         ณ 
 ณ                                                                           ณ 
 ณ   A compelling writing style, color illustrations throughout, and         ณ 
 ณ   scores of online resources make Real-Time Shader Programming an         ณ 
 ณ   indispensable tutorial/reference for the game developer, graphics       ณ 
 ณ   programmer, game artist, or visualization programmer, to create         ณ
