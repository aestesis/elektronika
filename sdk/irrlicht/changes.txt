-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.7: (fffff)

- The first version of Irrlicht.NET is included in this release. It is a managed C++
  wrapper .DLL which makes the most important features of the engine available for all
  .NET languages. The wrapper is incomplete, but it can already be used. 
  You can find the documentation for this .DLL in the compiled help file doc\IrrlichtNET.chm. 
  There are also two very basic examples available, which show how to use Irrlicht.NET 
  from C# and VisualBasic.
  
- Low level vertex and pixel shader programming is now possible. There are
  now some methods with wich you can write GPU programs in vertex/pixel shader assembler
  using Direct3D 8 and 9 and in ARB vertex and fragment program assembler for OpenGL.
  You can use the IGPUProgrammingServices interface which can be reached by 
  IVideoDriver->getGPUProgrammingServices() for this. The new material types you can create
  with this can be combined with all other already existing material types.
  For example, it is possible to create a new material which uses a vertex shader to
  calculate texture coordinates and diffuse colors, and let this be rendered by the built in
  material video::EMT_TRANSPARENT_ADD_COLOR.
  Support for high level programming languages like GLSL or HLSL is planned for the
  following releases. Also note that you won't be able to use all techniques shaders offer with
  Irrlicht, due to its current high level abstraction of the 3D APIs. For example, the engine 
  does not expose vertex streams or vertex buffers currently.  
  
- There is a new tutorial showing how to use shaders with the engine. In addition, all
  old tutorials have been rewritten and adapted. For example, the hello world
  tutorial now also shows how to set up visual studio .NET to use it with
  the engine.
  
- Hardware mip map level generation of textures is now supported when using D3D9. 

- Internal pointers and data of the video drivers can now be exposed for experienced users with
  VideoDriver::getExposedVideoData(). For example, you can get a pointer to the IDirect3DDevice9
  interface and the HWND window handle, if the engine is running with D3D9.

- The createDevice() function has a new additional parameter: bool vsync. With this, it is now
  possible to enable or disable the waiting for the vertical retrace period. This is implemented
  in D3D9, D3D8 and the OpenGL driver only, the software driver will ignore this flag.
  
- The engine now behaves like in the documentation: irr::createDevice() returns 0, if 
  the wanted driver could not be initialized.
  
- There is a new SceneNode available: The ITextSceneNode is able to display 2D text at a 
  position in 3D space. Use ISceneManager::addTextSceneNode() to create one.
  
- Finally now all VideoDrivers have a draw2DLine() implementation, thanks to some additions sent in
  by Vash TheStampede.
  
- Applied some changes to the compilation configuration, so that it should now be 
  easier to use the engine with XBOX projects. Thanks to MattyBoy for sending 
  in some clues for this.
  
- Some improvements for the linux version of the engine: The NULL device is finally fully operational with Linux
  too, and also all examples and even the techdemo compiles and runs with this operating system.
  
- The default field of view in the cameras of the irrlicht engine was a little bit 
  extreme, so I changed it now from core::PI / 3.5f to core::PI / 2.5f.
  
- Added a new draw2DImage method for partially draw a 2d Texture, as sent in by zola with 
  implementations for OpenGL, D3D8 and D3D9. Software implementation is missing.
  
- The string class is now able to convert integer values into a string or append it as string
  to itself.
  
- Added a getDriverType() method to the IVideoDriver interface.

- Added a getTransform() method to the IVideoDriver interface.
  
- The EMT_TRANSPARENT_ALPHA_CHANNEL material in OpenGL is now implemented.
  
- The integrated XML Parser now works better with different text file formats. (ASCII, UFT-16,..)
  
- IGUIEdit Box now feels more like a windows editbox, thanks to some changes by Jox

- Added a new method to IVideoDriver: createImageFromData as suggested by Oliver Klems. 
  
- Fixed a the EMT_TRANSPARENT_ALPHA_CHANNEL problem in D3D8 and D3D9 due to a suggestion by Jox.
  
- Added 3 methods created by zola to the quaternion class: fromAngleAxis(), toEuler() and
  operator*(vector3df&).

- A bug in a matrix multiplication operator was fixed.	
  
- Changed visual studio project files to version 7.1, but provided 7.0 project files
  for people with that version.
  
- Added SceneNodeAnimatorRotation rotation fix as posted by warui

- Added normalization fix to vector2d and 3d. Warui suggested a fix like that in the forum.
  The one I made has the same result, but is a little bit faster.
  
- Fixed some problems with the drawStencilShadow() method in the OpenGL implementation of the 
  IVideoDriver interface after some suggestions by Nicholas Bray.
  
- Added IGUIButton::setPressed() and isPressed().

- Fixed checkPrimitiveCount() bug in NullDevice.

- Applied jox's matrix4::getRotationDegrees() fix, many thanks for posting this!

- Changed aabbox3d::getExtend() to getExtent().
  
- Changed IXMLReader::isEmtpyElement() to isEmptyElement()

- Fixed a bug in CSceneManager::getSceneNodeFromId() which caused the engine to crash sometimes.

- Fixed a bug in CGUISkin::setSize reported by REAPER. This method never worked before.

- Improved texture mapping and normals of the TestSceneNode, thanks go again to Jox.

- ScrollBar is now posting mousewheel events, thanks go to REAPER to post this bug and a fix for it.

- Added - operator to vector2d and vector3d, thanks to calimero

- Fixed a bug in vector2d::getAngle() and vector2d::rotateBy() thanks to Jox.

- Fixed a bug in quaternion::set(f32 x, f32 y, f32 z) thanks again to Jox.

- Fixed a bug in list::insert_before and list::insert_after, reported by Haddock.

- Fixed a bug in XML Parser which caused a seqfault on linux. Thanks for G.o.D reporting this problem.

- EDriverType enumeration renamed to E_DRIVER_TYPE

- SceneNodeRenderTime enumeration renamed to E_SCENE_NODE_RENDER_TIME
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.6: (09 Mar 2004)

- Irrlicht now includes its own XML parser. It provides forward-only, read-only 
  access to a stream of non validated XML data. It can read everywhere Irrlicht can,
  also in compressed .zip-Files for example. Use IFileSystem::createXMLReader() to
  use it.
  
- Like the new XMLReader, there is also a IXMLWriter available for making it easier
  to write xml files.
  
- There is a new tutorial available in the SDK. It is for more advanced users, and
  shows how to create a 3d model viewer with the engine easily. It shows how to
  use menus, tabcontrols, edit-, message- and sky boxes.
  The resulting program  can also be used as tool, to check if the engine
  loads exported 3d models correctly.
  
- Again, there are some new GUI widgets available: A ComboBox, a ToolBar, a PushButton
  and an ImageButton. The last two are simply the old IGUIButton, but it is now able 
  to display additional images and behave like a PushButton.
  
- It is now possible to make the drawing window resizeable, if it is in windowed mode.
  Use IVideoDriver::setResizeAble(true) to do this.
  
- The .x file reader and animation player now should work with 99% of all text .x files.
  This is achieved by most of the following bug fixes.
  
- Fixed a huge bug in the .x file reader, which caused that negative coordinates were 
  interpreted as positive ones sometimes. This caused that sometimes .x animations
  were played wrong.

- Slerp interpolation of the quaternion class fixed. This means that also some bugs 
  in the animation of .x files are removed now.
  
- Added virtual joints to not weighted vertices to improve .x file animations.

- The FileSystem is now 100% implemented. Finally it is now possible to write files 
  too. There is a new Class IWriteFile and the corresponding 
  IFileSystem::createAndWriteFile()
  
- Added lots of text and sample code to the documentation. In most parts
  documentation should be clearer now. 
  
- The ISceneManager has a clear() method, which clears the whole scene, all scene nodes
  are removed. 
  
- All ISceneNodes now own a new method called removeAll(), which deletes all children
  of the node.
  
- Fixed a bug which prevented the possibility to compile directx8 without 
  having installed directx9.  
  
- Fixed a bug in 3d line dawing in D3D 8 and 9.

- All video drivers now print out the gfx adapter type, vendor and driver version 
  into the log strings.
  
- The D3D9 device is now as fast as the D3D8 device.  

- The string class has an additional new constructor for creating a string from
  character data with a specific lenght.
  
- Bug fixed in string class assignment operator which might cause a crash in very
  special circumstances.
  
- Added a findNext() method to the string class.

- The ISceneNode class now has a isDebugDataVisible() method.

- Some lines were changed to make the source of the engine compatible to VS.NET 2003.
  
- Some functionality of the IFileList and IFileSystem were missing in the Linux version
  of the engine. This caused the FileOpen-Dialog not to work. I fixed this problem.
  
- The Middle and Right mouse button were swapped in the Linux version. This is now
  fixed.
  
- Multitexturing should now work with most linux systems too, thanks to a bug
  report by Martin Piskernig.
  
- The logger now has an additional log() method which accepts another compination
  of strings.
  
- Fixed a bug which caused fonts to be displayed very transparent in OpenGL.

- Removed one of the redundant overloaded IGUIEnvironment::updateAbsolutePosition() 
  methods.
  
- Fixed lots of clipping problems in all GUI Widgets.

- core::rect has the new methods getCenter() and isValid().

- Scrollbar buttons are now disabled if it is not possible to scroll.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.5: (17 Feb 2004)

-------------------------------------
/ Highlights in short:
/ * DirectX 9 support
/ * .x file support in all render devices including opengl and software
/ * new materials like lightmaps with dynamic lighting
/ * fog
/ * stencil buffer shadows now also work in OpenGL device
/ * more gui widgets: tab controls, edit boxes, menus
/ * spline animation support
/ * mouse wheel support
/ * triangle fan drawing
/ * quaternions
/ * improved keyboard input control
/ * lots of bugfixes including improved quake 3 map support
-------------------------------------

- DirectX 9 is now supported by Irrlicht. This does not mean that it replaces
  DirectX 8. The engine now supports both. You can now select between OpenGL,
  DirectX8, DirectX9, Software and the Null device.

- The engine now is able to read and display .x files. Using
  Microsoft's excellent .x file exporter for Maya or MAX which comes
  with the DX8 and DX9 SDK, it is now possible to create content for
  the engine easily. Using .X files with Irrlicht is independent of D3D,
  they can be used with OpenGL and with Linux for example too.
  Currently only text file .x files are supported, and some animated .x
  files may be displayed not 100% correctly, because the animation player 
  may still have some small bugs. It works perfectly with most .x files which 
  come with the DX9-SDK. Some skinned mesh .x files which use 
  quaternions for animating joints have some problems, there might be a
  bug somewhere. I commented the lines with a possible bug in CXAnimationPlayer.cpp.
  
- The GUI Environment now supports edit boxes. They should support unicode input
  from every keyboard around the world, scrolling, copying and pasting (exchanging
  data with the clipboard directly), maximum character amount, marking and all 
  shortcuts like ctrl+X, ctrl+V, ctrg+C, shift+Left, shift+Right, Home, End, 
  and so on. Wow, I never programmed an edit box, its much more work than it
  seems to be. 
  
- Tabcontrols are now available in the GUI environment. It is also
  possible to create tabs without tabcontrols, to be able to create
  invisible gui elements for grouping other elements together.

- Another new supported GUI Element are context menus. They support
  ordinary text menu items, separators and sub menus. In Addition,
  a standard menu as seen at the top of most windows can be
  created easily with them.
  
- Rewrote all tutorials to fit the new API.
  
- Spline animations are now supported thanks to a spline scene node animator
  written by Matthias Gall.
  
- Taskswitching now works with Direct3D 8 and 9 devices in fullscreen mode. 
  
- Added Material types EMT_LIGHTMAP_LIGHTING, EMT_LIGHTMAP_LIGHTING_M2, 
  EMT_LIGHTMAP_LIGHTING_M4 and EMT_LIGHTMAP_ADD.
  
- The engine now supports drawing of trianglefans. To do this, use
  IVideoDriver::drawIndexedTriangleFan(). Mario Gruber sent in code for this,
  so lots of thanks go to him!
  
- It is now possible to draw 3d objects with fog. Simply switch on the fog flag
  in the objects material. To change to way fog is drawn (per pixel/vertex, color,
  linear/expontential) use IVideoDriver::setFog();
  
- With IrrlichtDevice::getOSOperator() a pointer to an interface is returned, with
  wich it is possible to do some operation system specific operations. Currently
  there are only 3 methods supported, but more will be added in the future.
  
- Mouse wheel input is now supported.
  
- The Key Event structure of SEvent now contains a Char entry, describing the 
  corresponding character of the pressed key. Also two bools were added,
  specifying if shift or ctrl was pressed too.

- The version of the Operating System is now printed out into the log at 
  startup.
  
- There is now a non-const getBoundingBox() method in IMeshBuffer and
  IMehs available.
  
- IGUIElement now has a method getElementFromId(), which searches children
  (and its children if wanted) for an element with a specific id. If you
  want to search all items, just do
  IGUIEnvironment::getRootGUIElement::getElementFromId().
  
- ISceneNode::updateAbsolutePosition() is now public
  
- Small bug fixed in CMeshManipulator::scaleMesh().

- The engine now supports Quaternions.

- A bug was fixed causing the windows caption not to be displayed in
  Windows 95/98/ME.
  
- IGUIEnvironment::getBuildInFont() was renamed to getBuiltInFont().

- IGUIElement::bringToFront() is able to brint a child to the front.
  Windows for example are now using this new feature.

- Changed the texture mapping of the test scene node a little bit based on 
  code sent in by Dr Andros C Bragianos.
  
- Added code to fix some bug in some ATI drivers. Thanks to ariaci for posting
  this code.
  
- Stencil buffer shadows now also work with the OpenGL device, they worked only
  in D3D in earlier versions. Lots of thanks go to Philipp Dortmann, who
  sent in a modification to the opengl driver!
  
- IGUIStaticText::setWordWarp() renamed to setWordWrap(), 
  IGUIStaticText::enableOverrrideColor() renamed to enableOverrideColor()
  [thanks to saigumi] 
  
- A bug was fixed, causing that the window was not able to be closed with Alt+F4
  in Win95/98.
  
- Optimized the Octree-Scene node a little bit for getting more rendering speed.
  Culling is now done with the real frustrum, not the bounding box around it.
  Speed increase is about 5%, it's not much but ok.
  
- Bug fixed in the Quake 3 .bsp file loader, which caused holes to appear in
  some maps.
  
- Combination of 3D displaying and drawing GUI elements was improved, and the 
  priority of input receiving of 3d cameras and gui elements swapped.
  
- A bug in the static text was fixed, which caused it to draw itself outside
  of its clipping rectangle.

- KeyFocus and MouseFocus methods in GUIEnvironment are now merged into one method.

- The Clamptexturecoordinates flag in the material was removed.

- IVideoDriver::draw3DLine in all devices was improved. 

- The devcpp-version of the binary DLL which comes with the SDK is now faster.
  I'll compile this version from now on always with optimization switched on.

- Other, Minor New/Changed methods in public interfaces:
	* buildShadowMatrix in matrix4
	* getRotationDegrees in matrix4 (sent in by Chev)
	* rotateVect in matrix4
	* linear_search in array
	* recalculateBoundingBox in MeshManipulator	
	* ISceneManager::addStaticText() now has a parameter for word wrapping
	* getCharacterFromPos() in IGUIFont
	* drawMeshBuffer() in IVideoDriver;
	* interpolate() in matrix4
	* getLast in array

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.4.2: (13 Dec 2003)

- The engine does no more use only 16 bit textures internaly. Now all 
  other texture formats are supported too. This means higher precision
  and better quality images. In this context, the ISurface interface has
  been replaced by IImage, and the ISurfaceLoader by IImageLoader.
  
- By changing the texture creation mode of the IVideoDriver, it is now
  possible to influence how textures are created: You can choose between
  'optimized for speed', 'optimized for quality' or simply set constant
  bit depth like 'always 32 bit'. Also, you can now enable and disable
  Mip map generation with these falgs. Take a look at 
  IVideoDriver::setTextureCreationFlag() for details.
  
- There is now some support for outdoor or terrain rendering available.
  You can create a static mesh from a heightmap and a texture using 
  ISceneManager::addTerrainMesh(). You can specify a huge texture if you
  like, even bigger as your hardware allows to render, because the texture
  will be slitted up if necessary. 
  Another possibility for doing terrain rendering is the new Terrain Scene
  node. But it is only in a very early alpha stage, I disabled for example
  the use of different level of details.
  
- It is now possible to load software images into memory from files on
  disk, without creating a hardware texture. You can do this by calling
  IVideoDriver::createImageFromFile(). This is very useful for example
  for loading heighmaps for terrain renderers.
  
- The Quake 3 Map Loader now supports curved surfaces, thanks to by Dean P. Macri
  who sent in his code. (He also sent in lots of other cool stuff, which I will merge 
  with the code of next releases, lots of thanks to him!)

- It is now possible to control what text is printed out to the console and
  the debug window of Visual Studio. By getting a pointer to the ILogger
  interface, is is possible to adjust if Warning, Error or Informational
  texts should be printed out. In addition, now every text can be catched
  by the event receiver.
  
- The engine is now capable of loading .PCX files. Only a few PCX formats
  are supported currently, but at least the common used formats 
  of most textures of the quake 2 models. Thanks go to Dean P. Macri who
  sent in the code for the new PCXLoader!
  
- A new Scene node is available, which simply does nothing. It is useful for doing
  advanced transformations or for structuring the scene graph.
  
- The ISceneManager::addOctTreeSceneNode() now takes AnimatedMeshes as parameter.
  If this new method is called, the first frame in the animated mesh is taken as
  mesh to construct the octree. This means that you won't have to write
  addOctTreeSceneNode(yourMesh->getMesh(0)) anymore, but can use
  addOctTreeSceneNode(yourMesh), which is a little bit more intuitive.
  
- The Driver type enumeration have been adapted to the Irrlicht
  naming conventions. For example instead of writing DT_OPENGL, now write
  EDT_OPENGL.
  
- The ITexture interface has two new methods for getting the size of the 
  texture: ITexture::getSize() and ITexture::getOriginalSize(). This replaces
  the old getDimension()-method and allows to disable bugs which are generated
  by the automatic scaling to optimal sizes of textures.
  
- There are some new keycodes available: KEY_COMMA, KEY_PLUS, KEY_MINUS, KEY_PERIOD.
  
- There are now 3 lightmap Material types: EMT_LIGHTMAP, EMT_LIGHTMAP_M2 and
  EMT_LIGHTMAP_M4, which are making the lightmaps 2 or 4 times brighter. If you used
  the Material EMT_LIGHTMAP in your code, you should replace it now with
  EMT_LIGHTMAP_M4.
  
- The transformation enumeration names have been adapted to the irrlicht
  naming conventions. For example instead of writing TS_VIEW, now write
  ETS_VIEW.
  
- Video driver feature enumeration names have been changed from 
  EK3DVDF_... to EVDF_...
  
- The GUIEnvironment now has a new method: getRootGUIElement(). With this it 
  is possible now to add external created custom GUI Elements to the gui environment,
  without an existing internal GUI element as parent.
  
- The setViewPort()-Method of the OpenGL-device now works, too. Nothing stands now
  in the way of creating splitscreen applications using the OpenGL device.
  Oliver Klems sent code for this, I slightly modified it. Thank you!
  
- Corrected a bug, which made the EMT_REFLECTION_2_LAYER Material disappear on some
  hardware.
  
- Sirshane sent in a bug fix: It is now possible to make the mouse cursor
  invisible in the Linux version of the engine. Thanx sirshane!
  
- getFrameNr() of IAnimatedMeshSceneNode is now public.

- Again a small bug in the 3ds file loader was fixed.

- A small bug causing light positions being transformed in the OpenGL
  driver in a different then in D3D. Thanx to Matthias Gall for reporting
  this!
  
- Typing error fixed: ISceneCollisionMananger::getRayFromScreenCoordiantes renamed to 
  getRayFromScreenCoordinates.
  
- Linux support with multitexturing and mipmap generation has been improved.
  
- A bug was fixed wich caused the Engine not to run when compiled
  as dynamic library under linux. Thanks to Shane Parker who pointed out
  the problem.
  
- A bug was fixed in position2d.h in the operator +=, and the list iterator now
  has per and postfix operators. Thanks to Isometric God for spotting this out.
  
- A bug was fixed in the Metatriangleselector, causing it to detect only collisions
  with the last TriangleSelector in it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.4.1: (18 Sep 2003)

- Input events are now processed faster than repaint and window events. This
  means that input commands now effect things directly, in earlier versions
  there could be a delay when there were low frames per second. Some people
  noticed this when moving with the fps camera in large levels: The camera
  sometimes stopped seconds after the button was released. This is now fixed.
  
- A Message Box is now available in the GUI Environment. It looks like the 
  windows message boxes and supports OK, Cancel, Yes and No buttons, which
  can be combined freely. Also, it shows multiline text and adjusts its size
  based on the amount of text it shows, so it should be very useful for displaying
  (debug) messages during runtime.
  
- It is now possible to make all windows (message boxes, file open dialogs, 
  simple windows) modal.  
  
- IGUIStaticText now supports multiline text via automatic word warp and manual
  line breaking with '\n'. You only need to switch it on with 
  yourText->setWordWrap(true);
  
- Non default MD2 animations are now supported. Which means simply that you can
  enumerate the names of all md2 animations and the AnimatedMeshSceneNode now supports
  a setMD2Animation() with a character string as parameter instead of a constant.
  
- You do not need an event receiver anymore for sending user events to the active
  camera, this is now done autmaticly. In addition, it is now possible to 
  set a new event receiver during runtime of the engine using IrrlichtDevice::
  setEventReceiver().
  
- It is now possible to disable and enable the input receiver of a camera. This
  is useful for example for removing the users control of the camera. To do this,
  call camera->setInputReceiverEnabled(false);
  
- The first person shooter camera now supports a keymap: You can define your own
  key mapping to control the camera when you create it with ISceneManager::
  addCameraSceneNodeFPS().
  
- Thanks to Jon Pry, the engine now also loads compressed TGA texture files. Now only
  8 bit palette using TGAs are missing. :)

- There are methods for converting 3d coordinates in 2d coordinates and the other
  way round. You can find them as two new methods of the  ISceneCollisionManager:
  getRayFromScreenCoordiantes() and getScreenCoordinatesFrom3DPosition().
  
- There are now access methods in IGUIWindow for getting pointers to the
  maximize, minimize and close buttons, to be able to remove them for 
  example.
  
- Before starting up the engine, a version check now is performed and a warning is 
  written, if Irrlicht.DLL version and header version of your application do
  not match.
  
- A bug with the skybox has been fixed: In OpenGL, it was possible to see the
  borders of the skybox. In addition, when a skybox was visible, there were
  errors in the texture coordinates of other meshes. This is all fixed now. 
  
- A bug has been fixed causing the engine to crash when removing gui childs 
  which where created inside the .dll but are removed from outside. 
  
- A bug was fixed causing the engine to crash when drawing debug data of 
  octtree scene nodes with geometry data with vertices with one texture
  coordiante.
  
- Multitexturing now works with linux, too. Thanx to Jon Pry again, for showing
  me where the problem was. 
  
- The bug (reported by saigumi) preventing scene nodes attached to a camera
  from moving correctly is now fixed.
  
- The "Climb-Walls" bug (reported first by Matthias Gall) is fixed. Gravity
  acceleration is now quadratic instead of linear.
  
- A warning is now printed out, if too many vertices are rendererd with one call
  than the hardware supports.

- Other, Minor New/Changed methods in public interfaces:
   * get and setText() in IGUISkin
   * += operators are now available in the string class.
   * setRelativePosition() in IGUIElement
   * enumeration EKEY_CODES renamed to EKEY_CODE
   * getMaximalPrimitiveCount() in IVideoDriver
   * getAnimationCount() in IAnimatedMeshMD2
   * getAnimationName() in IAnimatedMeshMD2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.4: (04 Sep 2003)

- Collision detection and reponse based on ellipsoids in now implemented.
  There is a new method available in the ISceneCollisionMananger, which returns
  a collision response point. In addition, a new SceneNodeAnimator is available,
  which causes a scene node, to which it is attached to, not to move through
  walls, to climb stairs and to be affected by gravity. This scene node animator
  can be attached to any scene node. For example adding it to the FPSCamera, it makes
  the user possible to walk through the 3d world as in first person shooters.

- There is now a full featured Particle System included in the engine for
  creating fire, explosions, snow, smoke and so on.
  It is cusomizeable and extensible. There is a ParticleSystemScene node
  available in the SceneManager and some standard particle emitters and
  affectors are already implemented.
  
- Realistic water: The engine now features a IWaterSurfaceScene node, which
  animates a static mesh with water waves. In combination with the new
  EMT_REFLECTION or EMT_TRANSPARENT_REFLECTION material type, you can easily
  create realistic animated water surfaces.
  
- Triangle base picking is now possible using the ISceneCollisionMananager.
  If a collision happened, the intersecoin point and the triangle causing
  the intersection is returned.
  
- Stencil shadows are now drawn using the ZFail method by default, but it is 
  possible to choose ZPass, if wished. This means that the camera may now move
  inside the shadow volumes and no errors will occur. In addition a stencil
  shadow bug is now fixed: In 0.3 there where no shadows visible in the TechDemo.
  
- The interface of ISceneNode has changed: There is no more a RelativeTransformation
  and AnimatedRelativeTransformation matrix. They have been replaced by 3 vectors:
  RelativeTranslation, RelativeRotation and RelativeScale, which can be accessed by
  the corresponing get() and set() methods. This simplifies the interface 
  a lot. Also, the set/getRelativePosition was renamed to set/getPosition. 
    
- The new IAnimatedMeshMD2 interface now returns start, begin time and
  fps of every MD2 animation type. In this context, IAnimatedMeshSceneNode
  got a new method called setMD2Animation(), which accepts a single constant
  like EMAT_ATTACK, which starts and plays the fitting animation (attack
  animation in this case), simplifying the interface a lot.
  
- Some scene nodes can now draw debug data like their bounding boxes.
  This feature is switched on for a single node by calling 
  ISceneNode::setDebugDataVisible(true). Looks really interesting for
  animated scene nodes like particle systems or animated meshes.
  
- There is now a IGUIInOutFader avaiable, which is able to fade in or
  out the whole screen or parts of it.
  
- The new IVideoModeList is a list with all available video modes. It can
  be retrieved with IrrlichtDevice::getVideoModeList(). If you are confused 
  now, because you think you have to create an Irrlicht Device with a video
  mode before being able to get the video mode list, let me tell you that
  there is no need to start up an Irrlicht Device with DT_DIRECTX8, DT_OPENGL or
  DT_SOFTWARE: For this (and for lots of other reasons) the null device,
  DT_NULL exists.
  
- With the new IMeshManipulator interface accessible with
  ISceneManager::getMeshManipulator() it is possible to perform some basic 
  operations on meshes: Flipping all surfaces, recalculating all normals, 
  scaling the mesh, creating a new texture mapping and so on.
  
- A new material for creating water surfaces or glass with reflections on it
  is available: EMT_REFLECTION_2_LAYER and EMT_TRANSPARENT_REFLECTION_2_LAYER.
  It has uses a reflection map, and an additional optional texture.
  The transparency of this material is set by the alpha color value in the vertices. 
  
- Another new material is EMT_SOLID_2_LAYER. It is a material with 2 textures,
  blended together with the alpha value of the vertex color. This material is
  currently only available in DirectX.
  
- Trilinear Filtering is now supported the engine.
  There is a new option in SMaterial: TrilinearFilter and EMF_TRILINEAR_FILTER.
  
- The addChild() method of the IAnimatedMeshSceneNode for adding SceneNodes to
  joints of skeletal animated meshes was removed.
  Instead there is now a new method: getMS3DJointNode(). This returns a pointer
  to a child node, wich has the same transformation as the corrsesponding joint.
  In this way it is possible to do more advanced operations with joints and 
  attaching scene nodes to joints. Also, the IAnimatedMeshMS3D interface now gives
  access to all joints. In this way, you can easily enumerate all names of all
  joints in the mesh.
  
- Font and color of every IGUIStaticText can now be set separately, without
  modifying the IGUISkin.
  
- There is now a ELEMENT_LEFT gui event, which all hovered elements receive when they
  are left.
  
- All features of the FileOpenDialog are now working.
  
- Debug informations are now printed out to the console window
  also on the win32 platform.
  
- FPSCamera now supports setTarget(). Its not precise but working.

- Textures of 3ds files are now loaded from the same directory in which the
  3ds file is. If the texture is not found there, the texture is tried to be 
  loaded from the current working directory. 
  
- A small bug in the 3ds file loader has been fixed. There where 3ds files exported
  by anim8or, where the reading of the 3ds file never stopped.
  
- It is now possible to configurate the minimal amount of polygons contained
  in every node in an OctTree via addOctTreeSceneNode().
  
- There is a new template class in the core namespace: triangle3d. With this,
  it is easy to find intersections between lines and triangles, find out if 
  a point is within a triangle and so on.
  
- A small bug in ISceneManager::addHillPlaneMesh() was fixed: Now the right tile
  amount is created.
  
- There is a new SceneNode available: IDummyTransformationSceneNode. It exists
  for making it possible to insert matrix transformations anywhere into the 
  scene graph.
  
- Added a new SceneNode animator for deleting Scene nodes automaticly after some
  time. Create it with ISceneManager::createDeleteAnimator().
  
- The techdemo now is interactive. After a short non-interactive flight over
  the quake 3 level, you are placed as player inside the level, may move around,
  shoot fire balls and take a look at some animated characters which are placed
  on the map.
  
- I fixed a bug which caused the screen get black when choosing shadows and fullscreen
  on some special 3d adapters. 

- I fixed some bugs in the linux port: The timer returned an incorrect time, causing
  wrong animations everywhere and the releasing of keys and mouse buttons was not 
  sent as event. In addition, I placed a copy of the zlib.a and jpeglib.a into the
  /lib/Linux directory and changed the Makefiles of the examples and the source
  of the engine for doing this automaticly in the future, so I hope there will be no
  problems with other versions of zlib and jpeglib anymore.
  
- There are 2 new tutorials: One showing how to do collision detection and 
  for special effects.

- Other, Minor New/Changed methods in public interfaces:
  * getVersion() in IrrlichtDevice
  * getLengthSQ() in vector3d
  * getInterpolated() in vector3d
  * getInterpolated() in SColor
  * getAngle() in vector2d

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.3: (18 Jul 2003)

- Linux port: The Irrlicht Engine now compiles and runs on Linux. Currently only
  the OpenGL driver is available. The Software driver would be there too, if 
  somebody could tell me a fast way to blit a A1R5G5B5 surface to the screen
  using X.
  All examples do compile and run, but there are some things missing:
   * It is not yet possible to make the mouse cursor invisibe.
   * The timer seems not to return the currect time.
   * Multitexturing does not work correctly on all gfx adapters.
  
- Ms3D Animations: The engine is now able to play skeletal animations directy
  from Milkshape 3D (.ms3d) files. It is also possible to attach objects to
  parts of the animated mesh. For example a weapon to the left hand of 
  the animated model.

- Because the swprintf function in Windows32 does not match the ISO C standard,
  and it does in linux and all other platforms, there is now a define in Irrlicht.h,
  to make the code be the same on all platforms:
  #define   swprintf   _snwprintf
  This simply means that you need to add a parameter to your swprintf calls if
  you used this function in your win32 irrlicht engine projects. For example instead
  of writing 
      wchar_t tmp[255]; 
      swprint(tmp, "FPS: %d", fps);
  you now write
      wchar_t tmp[255]; 
      swprint(tmp, 255, "FPS: %d", fps);

- Automatic culling has changed a little bit: It is now done by the SceneManager.
  Scene nodes now only need to return a valid, non transformed bounding box to be 
  culled automaticly. It is explaned in the CustomSceneNode Tutorial how this works.
  
- It is now possible to use the engine easily for 2D graphics: There are now to new
  methods in the IVideoDriver, which create an 1bit alpha channel for textures 
  using an color key. The methods are both named makeColorKeyTexture. There is a 
  tutorial '2d graphics' which explains how this works.
  
- The rect template class was removed and replaced by the rectEx class. There
  is now only one rectangle template available, called 'rect' for simplifying
  the interface.
  
- The texture coordinate bug in Milkshape 3d models with lots of shared vertices
  was fixed.
  
- Bugfix with GUI environment hovering invisible elements.

- There are two new tutorials: One for 2d graphics, and one for user interface.

- Tutorial changes:
   * All backslashes replaced by slashes in file names in 
     all tutorials for linux compatibility.     
   * RectEx replaces with rect in 1.HelloWorld
   * Added second parameter to swprintf in 2.Quake3Map
   * Added bounding box creation to 3.CustomSceneNode
   * Added second parameter to swprintf in 4.Movement
  
- New/Changed methods in public interfaces:
   * getClosestPoint in line3d	 
   * getMatrixOfMeshPart in IAnimatedMesh
   * removeChild in ISceneNode now returns true or false
   * addChild in IAnimatedMeshSceneNode
   * setParent in ISceneNode

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.2.5: (22 Jun 2003)

- A new material type is available: EMT_TRANSPARENT_VERTEX_ALPHA, which
  realizes transparency based on the vertex alpha color. It currently is
  only implemented in the DirectX device.

- There is now an ISceneCollisionManager available. Get it with 
  getSceneCollisionManager() from the ISceneManager. It currently only implements
  picking, but more is coming soon.

- Automatic Culling based on Bounding Boxes is implemented now. It can be switched on
  or off for every SceneNode seperately using ISceneNode::setAutomaticCulling().
  It is on by default.
  
- It is now possible to remove loaded textures for freeing memory or reloading them.
  Use IVideoDriver::removeTexture() or removeAllTextures().

- New drawing methods in the IVideoDriver interface:
   * Draw3dLine(), drawing a 3d line.
   * Draw3dBox(), which draws an axis aligned bounding box.
   * Draw2dLine(), currently only supported by the Software device.

- MD2 bugfixes:
   * There was a small bug with texture coordinates.
   * Frames are now correctly interpolated when playing animations.

- Bugfix in the 3ds file format loader: Single objects in the 3ds file with multiple
  materials attached are now loaded correctly.
  
- list.h renamed to irrlist.h due to compatibility issues.

- Now works with Dev-C++ 5 Beta 8. (4.9.8.0)
  
- New/Changed methods in public interfaces:
   * 'getInverse' in matrix4.
   * 'transformBox' in matrix4.
   * 'repair' in aabbox.
   * 'intersectsWithLine' in aabbox.
   * 'getVector' in line3d.
   * 'getMiddle' in line3d.
   * 'normalize' method in vector3d and vector2d now returns reference to vector.
   * 'getTransformedBoundingBox' in ISceneNode.
   * 'getChildren' in ISceneNode
   * 'setRotation' in ISceneNode
   * 'addHillPlaneMesh' in ISceneManager now accepts a texture repeat count parameter.
   

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.2: (19 May 2003)

- The engine is now able to load .3ds files, with their materials and textures.

- There are some new SceneNodeAnimators: A fly straight animator and a texture animator.

- Texture coordinates can now be set to clamp or wrap mode with 
  a flag in the SMaterial struct.
  
- Skyboxes are implemented.

- Billboards now work 100% correctly.

- The IAnimatedMeshSceneNode is now able to draw shadows of itself. To enable this, just call
  addShadowVolumeSceneNode(). Please note that shadows are currently just experimental,
  there are some bugs, and they only only in Direct3D mode.

- A small bug in the view frustrum and the octree fixed.

- The default aspect ratio in all camera scene nodes were changed.

- Some changes and extenstions to the core::matrix4, SViewFrustum, plane3d and
  aabbox were made. The plane3dex was removed, there is now only one plane implementation
  available. Implemented some ideas and suggestions by Mark Jeacocke. Thanx a lot!

- The interface for adding dynamic lights has been enhanced. There are some new methods
  for handling dynamic light in the IVideoDriver interface. For example, it is now possible
  to change the ambient light.

- There is a new parameter in the createDevice() function, which specifies if the 
  stencil buffer should be activated. Also, now all parameters have default parameters.

- There is now a timer object to get the current timer. It can be received using
  the getTimer() method from the IrrlichtDevice.

- The first person shooter camera is now able to be moved by external using 
  setRelativePosition() and the sceneNodeAnimators. In addition, it now supports 
  multiple FPS cameras.
  
- Mesh format loading extenstions are now possible. To extend the engine with a
  mesh format it currently does not support (e.g. .cob), just implement a 
  IMeshLoader interface and add it to the engine calling 
  ISceneManager::addExternalMeshLoader().

- It is now possible to extend the Irrlicht Engine easily with new texture file format
  loaders. If there is an image file format the engine does not support (for example
  .gif files) the IImageLoader interface can be implemented to load .gif files 
  and added to the engine via IVideoDriver::addExternalSurfaceLoader().
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.1.5: (03 Apr 2003)

- The zlib and libjpeg are now included in the SDK.

- It is now possible to let the scene manager generate a hilly plane on the fly.

- The Interface for handling dynamic lights was simplified.

- The OpenGL 2D and 3D device is now full implemented.

- There is now a way to access to root scene node from the scene manager, and so it
  is possible to add external created custom scene nodes to the scene.

- There is a new Camera control scene node available in the engine: First Person Shooter
  Camera Control. Look with mouse movement, move and strafe with the cursor keys.

- The engine now compiles with g++ and the Microsoft compilers, which enables it to
  develop applications for the engine with VisualC++6.0, VisualC++.NET and Dev-C++.

- There is now a ICursorControl available in the engine, which is able to modify the
  mouse cursor: Get/Set the position of the cursor, make it invisible or visible.

- video::Color was renamed to video::SColor to fit the Irrlicht Engine naming conventions
  and for g++ compatibility issues in the Vertices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes of version 0.1: (14 Mar 2003)

  This is an alpha version of the SDK. So please note that there are
  features missing in the engine and maybe also some bugs. The following
  list is a complete list of parts of this alpha SDK which do not work
  100% correct. All other parts which can be found in the documentation
  and accessed with the Irrlicht header files work and can already be 
  used. 
  
- OpenGL Device
  The OpenGL Device is currently only able to load textures and draw basic 
  3D primitives. No 2D functions, complex materials and dynamic light are
  implemented. Please use the DirectX8 or the Software Device instead. 
  In the next release (0.2) the OpenGL device will be complete.
  
- Software Device
  Dynamic lighting, multitexturing, 3d clipping and bilinear filtering are
  not implemented because the Software Device was intented to to only 2d 
  functions, the primitive 3d functions are only an addition. Until the
  first non beta release (1.0) of the Engine, some more 3d functionality
  will be added.
  
- BspTree
  The binary space partition scene node does not work correctly and has 
  some bugs in it, which might lead to crashes. Please use the OctTree
  scene node instead. There is nearly no difference between the interface
  of them.

- MeshViewerGUIElement
  The camera control of this element is currently disabled.
  
- FileOpenDialog
  Not all functions are implemented.
  
- Render to Texture support
  Is not implemented yet.
  
- MS3D Skeletal Animation
  A loaded mesh is currently not animated and only drawn static.
  
- Quake 3 maps
  No support for curved surfaces yet.
  
- Linux Support
  The engine currently only runs with Windows platforms. A linux version
  will be available somewhere between the versions 0.2 and 0.5, it depends
  on the need of the users.
